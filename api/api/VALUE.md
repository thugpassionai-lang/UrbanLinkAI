## How Dating Platforms Make Money

Match Group earns revenue when users:
• Subscribe
• Stay active
• Keep swiping
• Keep messaging
• Keep paying

They lose money when users:
• Get frustrated
• Feel unseen
• Get ghosted
• Give up
• Cancel subscriptions

UrbanLinkAI directly targets the reasons users leave.

## Example Revenue Impact

If just 5% of Match Group’s users:
• Stay subscribed one month longer
• Or upgrade to premium
• Or avoid deleting the app

That represents **tens of millions of dollars annually**.

UrbanLinkAI does not require:
• New users
• New ads
• New marketing

It monetizes the users Match already has.

## Why This Is Strategic

Dating apps compete on:
• User acquisition
• Branding
• Features

UrbanLinkAI creates a new competitive moat:
**relationship intelligence**

Once integrated, competitors cannot copy it without years of data and modeling.

## What Match Group Would Actually Be Buying

Not code.

They would be buying:
• A compatibility engine
• A scoring system
• A relationship model
• A proprietary intelligence layer
• A future-proofed platform

This is the type of asset companies acquire for:
• Strategic advantage
• Data leverage
• Platform control
